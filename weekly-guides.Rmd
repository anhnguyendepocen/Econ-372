# Overview 
Here, I provide a guide for each week of class. I will post a new guide each week. The goal of each guide is simply to highlight the material for that week. By the end of the semester, this should be one large file that you can easily navigate to see what was done during each week of class.

# Week 1: Welcome!
Welcome to Economics of Health Care Markets! We're going to have a great time this semester and learn a ton about economics, health care, and health policy.

### Objectives for this week
- Recall the total annual expenditures on health and health care in the U.S.
- Compare U.S. health expenditures and quality to that of other countries
- Explain the debate surrounding the role of prices in U.S. health care expenditures
- Summarize some of the unique economic features of the U.S. health care market
 

### Activities 
- Discussion of U.S. health care expenditures and quality
- Overview of class and introductions

# Week 3: Insurance demand
Welcome back! This week we'll finish our discussion of risk premiums and apply these tools to examine demand for health insurance (i.e., willingness to pay for health insurance).

 
### Objectives for this week
- Explain and draw graphically how the risk premium varies with the curvature of the utility function, probability of illness, and amount of potential loss
- Calculate risk premium and willingness-to-pay for health insurance
- Discuss viability of high-risk pools
 

### Activities

# Week 4: Adverse selection
Welcome back! This week we'll broaden our study of insurance purchasing to the market level and study how the presence of adverse selection can affect insurance markets and premiums.

### Objectives for this week
- Explain and draw graphically a simplified insurance market with adverse selection
- Calculate the insurer loss or profit at a given price
- Calculate the equilibrium price in the market under some assumptions on insurer profitability
- Solve for the subsidy amount or penalty amount that would ensure full insurance in a market

# Week 5: Insurance policy
This week concludes our study of health insurance. We'll finish this module with a discussion of some real world issues related to health insurance markets in the U.S.

 
### Objectives for this week
- Explain the history of the employer-provided health insurance market in the U.S.

# Week 6: Agency problems
 
We're starting a new module this week related to physician treatment decisions. Just as asymmetric information between patients and insurance companies was a big part of the adverse selection problem, this module will show how asymmetric information between physicians and patients can also create some interesting dynamics and incentives.

### Objectives for this week

- Explain the principal-agent problem in the context of medical care
- Define fee-for-service and capitated payment models
- Solve for treatment levels under fee-for-service and capitated payments
 

### Activities

# Week 7: Agency and payments
 
This week we'll continue our study of physician agency and treatment decisions, focusing in particular on fee-for-service versus "capitated" payments.
