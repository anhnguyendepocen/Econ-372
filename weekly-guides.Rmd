# Overview 
Here, I provide a guide for each week of class. I will post a new guide each week. The goal of each guide is simply to highlight the material for that week. By the end of the semester, this should be one large file that you can easily navigate to see what was done during each week of class.

# Week 6: Agency problems
 
We're starting a new module this week related to physician treatment decisions.

# Week 9: Hospital pricing

Hey class! This week is the start of a brand new process, and it comes alongside a slew of uncertainty in many other dimensions of our daily lives. One of the most important things going forward...let's all be patient with each other. Many of us (myself include) are dealing with other changes and disruptions. But we will work together and get through this!

In terms of class material, this week starts our third and final section of material related to hospital pricing. 

### Objectives for this week
The broad goals for this week are to review the mid-term and finish the **Motivation** and **What do hospital's maximize** sections of the [hospital pricing slides](04-Pricing/04-slides.html). More specifically, by the end of this week everone should be able to:<br>

1. Define and explain the differences between hospital prices, charges, and costs
2. Understand variation in hospital pricing and investigate price variation with the Health Care Pricing Project materials
3. Define and contrast a for-profit and not-for-profit hospital
4. Assess the merits and potential pitfalls of the criteria for a not-for-profit hospital

### Activities and materials
These activities are intended to facilitate an engaged "virtual" classroom on Zoom. Each activity or set of activities will align with pre-recorded materials. The goal is to watch the pre-recorded materials, spend 10-20 minutes on the relevant activities, and then join the live Zoom classroom to participate in the group discussion. We also have a new discussion forum (Discussion 4) this week on [Canvas](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/70035).<br>

  - What do we mean when we say hospital "price"?
  - What factors do you think can explain the differences in hospital prices (even for homogeneous products like MRIs)?

# Week 10: Hospital competition

This week we continue our coverage of hospital pricing, focusing on the role of competition and mergers.

### Objectives for this week
The broad goal for this week is to finish the **Pricing and Negotiations** section of the [hospital pricing slides](04-Pricing/04-slides.html). By the end of this week everone should be able to:<br>

1. Explain how we model pricing for not-for-profit hospitals and distinguish this from the for-profit framework
2. Solve for a profix maximizing price and quantity in a monopolist or monopolistic competition setting
3. Describe the hospital negotiation process as a Nash bargaining problem and solve a simple version of a Nash bargaining model
4. Explain the role of competition on pricing and describe how we measure competition in health care


### Activities and materials
