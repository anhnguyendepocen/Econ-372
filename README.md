# Econ 372: Economics of Health Care Markets

This is an elective economics course focusing on "supply side" health economics issues taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. The course examines the industrial organization of health care markets in the U.S., including underlying theory,
empirical findings, and related health care policy. We will study insurance markets, informational asymmetries between physicians and patients, as well as issues of hospital pricing and payments

Before going much further, please be sure to read the [syllabus](Syllabus/Econ372-Syllabus.pdf). This will give you a sense of what to expect in the course as well as details of specific assignments and projects. Below are the lecture notes and underlying code files for the class. This site is very much a work in progress, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. 

## Notes and slides
Below are all of the slides that I'll use throughout the class. The slides will open as html files. Note that I've disabled "touch" navigation, which means that it's not possible to advance the slides with a touchscreen. I did this because I will record the screen in each class, and I'll annotate the slides throughout the class. If you want to see the slides in standard presentation format, you will need to access everything on a desktop or laptop rather than a phone or tablet. Everything is still accessible on a mobile platform, you just need to open the "simplified" view. I've provided a link for that view in each section. The simplified view will remove the slide/presentation formatting and allow you just to see the whole content as one big website. Some content won't display in the same way, but the content itself will be there.
